    <p>Hello,</p>
    <p>I am from a little area called Bridger Valley, WY and 
        live here with my wife, dog, and cat.
    </p>
    <p>This is my first ever class here at BYUI. I am 
        pursuing my Bachelors Degree of Applied Technology 
        and am excited to have this as my first class.
    </p>
    <p>Some of the things that I love to do are gaming, listening to music,  
        and tinkering/crafting with either Legos or other miniature
		models. I also enjoy working with computers and have even had the 
		chance to build my own a couple of times.
    </p>
    <p>I currently work for a local telephone company and work 
        in the engineering department there.
    </p>
    <p>I would like to wish everyone a wonderful and happy New Year at the start of this class.</p>
