        <p>Computers are a helpful tool that serve many different purposes in our everyday life. Some people use them for gaming while others just use them to browse the web.</p> 
        <p>There is a benefit to learning how to build a computer and how to troubleshoot it. It will give you a sense of security in knowing that you can be self-reliant in fixing issues that pop up with your device.</p> 
        <p>General Terms:</p>
        <p>Motherboard: The backbone of your computer that all components will be connected to</p>
        <p>Ram: Random-Access Memory – memory for the short term storage of information as it is being handled and processed</p> 
        <p>CPU: Central Processing Unit – the main brain of your computer</p>
        <p>PSU: Power Supply Unit – The power provider for the entire computer</p>
        <p>SSD: Solid State Drive – The same function of memory as a Hard Drive but faster in access and writing</p>

      <h3>Building a Computer</h3>
      <p>
        <p>Building a computer can be a daunting task if you have never had the chance to do it before. On this page we are going to be going through some simple steps that you can look through so that you can start off on the right foot.</p>
        <p>Gather parts</p>
        <p>This may be one of the most important steps. Make sure that wherever you get the parts for your computer that it is from a good reputable source and that they won’t be giving you faulty parts with no chance of getting a refund.</p>
        <p>Find a space</p>
        <p>This second step is in regards to finding a place in your home that you can put the computer together that does not have a high amount of static electricity around (solid floors, grounded mat or work table) as very small amounts of that static electricity can be enough to destroy a computer component and have it be unusable.</p>
        <p>Lay it out</p>
        <p>Make sure that before you start to build your computer that you have all the parts that you need and tools that you need to build it. You don’t want to build right in the middle of holding a piece in place and not be able to have the correct tool nearby to put it in place.</p> 
        <p>Build it</p>
        <p>Here is the main focal point step. Make sure that when you build your computer that you are following the proper static electricity safety guidelines. You may want to first put smaller items on the motherboard such as the CPU and ram. Then go ahead and install the motherboard into the case. Now you can go ahead and install the PSU and other fan components that you need for your case. Then you are able to put in your Hard Drives, SSD’s or other extra components like a graphics card. Following these general steps will help you put together your computer and have an enjoyable time in doing so.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
      <p>
        <p>Ways to troubleshoot</p>
        <p>There are many ways to troubleshoot the issues that occur on your computer. Issues can happen at any time with your computer whether you are just starting to build it or you have had it working for several years. There are different ways to troubleshoot and depending on what it is that is having the issue you can approach the process in different ways.</p>
        <p>Lights/Audio</p>
        <p>While you are building your computer there are different parts that can help and warn you if there are issues. Sometimes the motherboard will have an area that will have LED’s that light up during the boot up process and signal if there is a hold up at any point. The motherboard may also have a specific port that it will send specific audio cues or beeps to give more detailed error codes in order to troubleshoot.</p> 
        <p>Manuals</p>
        <p>Many parts manuals will have a troubleshooting section that will have you run through simple troubleshooting processes in order to fix the issue. These manuals can either be physical or digital copies depending on what the company for the part decides to use.</p> 
        <p>Software</p>
        <p>Once your computer is put together and can run, it may run into software issues. There are many different troubleshooting software’s that can help you find out what is causing the issues on your computer. Be sure to use caution while looking for software online though as there may be software that is only out there to trick you into giving up access to your computer.</p>
