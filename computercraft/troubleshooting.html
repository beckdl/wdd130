                While you are building your computer there are different parts that can help and warn you if there are issues. Sometimes the motherboard will have an area that 
                will have LED’s that light up during the boot up process and signal if there is a hold up at any point. The motherboard may also have a specific port that it will 
                send specific audio cues or beeps to give more detailed error codes in order to troubleshoot.
            </p>
            <p>Manuals</p>
            <p>
                Many parts manuals will have a troubleshooting section that will have you run through simple troubleshooting processes in order to fix the issue. These manuals 
                can either be physical or digital copies depending on what the company for the part decides to use.
            </p>
            <p>Software</p>
            <p>
                Once your computer is put together and can run, it may run into software issues. There are many different troubleshooting software’s that can help you find out 
                what is causing the issues on your computer. Be sure to use caution while looking for software online though as there may be software that is only out there to 
                trick you into giving up access to your computer.
